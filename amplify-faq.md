## 1. General

### 1.1. What is NGINX Amplify?

NGINX Amplify is a tool designed to monitor and optimize application delivery infrastructure. With Amplify it becomes possible to proactively analyze and fix problems related to running and scaling modern web applications.

You can use NGINX Amplify to do the following:

 * Visualize and identify performance bottlenecks, overloaded servers, or potential DDoS attacks
 * Improve and optimize NGINX performance with intelligent advice and recommendations
 * Get notified when something is wrong with the application delivery
 * Plan web application capacity and performance
 * Keep track of the systems running NGINX
 
### 1.2. Where is the main system hosted?

NGINX Amplify SaaS is currently hosted in [AWS us-west-1](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) (US West, N. California).

### 1.3. Is the traffic from the agent to the SaaS protected?

All communications between the Amplify Agent and the Amplify SaaS are done securely over TLS/SSL. All traffic is always initiated by the agent. The SaaS system doesn't establish any connections back to the agent running on a host.

### 1.4. Is the Amplify Agent code publicly available?

Amplify Agent is an open source application. It is licensed under the [2-clause BSD license](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-agent/blob/master/LICENSE), and it's available [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-agent).

### 1.5. Why is my password asked when installing the agent?

It could be that you're starting the install script from a non-root account. In this case you will need *sudo* rights. That's most probably *sudo* asking for a password.


## 2. Amplify Agent

### 2.1. What operatings systems are supported?

Amplify Agent currently works on the following Linux flavors only:

 * Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 15.04, 15.10
 * Debian 7, 8
 * CentOS 6, 7
 * Red Hat 6, 7
 * Amazon Linux

### 2.2. What version of Python is required?

Amplify Agent will work with Python 2.6+.

### 2.3. How do I add a new a system to the monitoring?

This could done as simple as:

 1. Download and run install script.

        # curl -sS -L -O \
        https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-agent/raw/master/packages/install.sh && \
        API_KEY='ecfdee2e010899135c258d741a6effc7' sh ./install.sh

    Where API_KEY is a unique API key assigned when you create an account with Amplify. You will see your API key when adding new system in the Amplify UI.

 2. Verify that Amplify agent is started.

        # ps ax | grep -i 'amplify\-'
        2552 ?        S      0:00 amplify-agent

For manual installation instructions, please see the user guide [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-doc/blob/master/amplify-guide.md#installing-amplify-agent-manually).

### 2.4. What do I need to get the Agent reporting metrics?

After you install and start the agent, normally it should just start reporting right away, pushing aggregated data to the SaaS in regular 1 minute intervals. It'll take about a minute for the new system to appear in the Amplify UI.

If you don't see the new system in the UI, or metrics aren't being collected, please make sure that:

 1. Amplify Agent package has been successfully installed
 2. `amplify-agent` process is running
 3. [stub_status](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html) is properly set up in your NGINX configuration
 4. NGINX [access.log](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html) and [error.log](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#error_log) files are readable by the user `nginx` (or by the [user](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#user) configured in NGINX config)
 5. Oubound TLS/SSL from the system is not restricted
 6. System DNS resolver is properly configured, and `receiver.amplify.nginx.com` can be successfully resolved.
 7. Check if *selinux(8)* interferes. Check `/etc/selinux/config`, try `setenforce 0` temporarily and see if it improves the situation.

### 2.5. How to verify if the Amplify Agent is properly installed

 1. On Ubuntu/Debian

```
    # dpkg -s nginx-amplify-agent
```

 2. On CentOS and Red Hat

```
    # yum info nginx-amplify-agent
```

### 2.6. How can I update the agent?

 1. On Ubuntu/Debian use
 
```
    # apt-get update && \
    apt-get install nginx-amplify-agent

    # service amplify-agent restart
```

 2. On CentOS use

```
    # yum makecache && \
    yum update nginx-amplify-agent

    # service amplify-agent restart
```

### 2.7. How much system resources are required?

We worked very hard to make the agent retain as small memory and CPU footprint as possible. Normally it shouldn't be more than a few % of CPU time, and around 25-30MB of RSS memory.
   
### 2.8. How to restart the agent

It's simply

```
    # service amplify-agent restart
```

### 2.9 How can I uninstall the agent?

 1. On Ubuntu/Debian use


```
    apt-get remove nginx-amplify-agent
```

 2. On CentOS and Red Hat use

```
    yum remove nginx-amplify-agent
```

### 2.10 How can I (re)define hostname?
 
If the agent is not able to determine system's hostname, you can define it manually in `/etc/amplify-agent/agent.conf`. Check for the following section, and fill in the desired hostname:

```
    [credentials]
    ..
    hostname = myhostname1
```

Hostname should be something real — the following aren't valid hostnames:

 * localhost
 * localhost.localdomain
 * localhost6.localdomain6
 * ip6-localhost

## 3. User interface

### 3.1. What browsers are supported?

Currently the following desktop browsers are officially fully supported:

 * Chrome
 * Firefox
 * Safari

### 3.2. Is UI traffic secure?

We only support TLS/SSL connections to the web UI.

### 3.3. How can I delete a system or an NGINX instance from monitoring?

If the goal is to completely delete previously monitored object, then do the following:

 * Uninstall the agent
 * Delete objects from the UI
 * Delete alarms

To delete system from the UI — find it in the list, hover, click vertical dots on the right, extend toolbar and choose the [i] icon. There you can delete objects from the UI.

Bear in mind — deleting objects there will not stop the agent. To completely remove system from monitoring, stop or deinstall the agent first, and then clean it up in the UI. Don't forget to also clean up any alarms.


## 4. Metrics and metadata

### 4.1. What metrics and metadata is collected

Amplify agent collects the following type of data:

 * **System metadata.** This is basic information about the OS environment where the agent runs. This could be hostname, uptime information, and so on.
 * **System metrics.** This is various data describing key system characteristics, e.g. CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic etc.
 * **NGINX metadata.** This is what describes your NGINX instances, and it includes package data, build information, path to binary, configure options etc. NGINX metadata also includes config file breakdown.
 * **NGINX metrics.** Amplify Agent collects NGINX related metrics from [stub_status](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html), and also from the NGINX logs files.

Amplify Agent will mostly use Python's [psutil()](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) to collect the data, but occasionally may also invoke certain system utilities like *ps(1)*.

### 4.2. How is the NGINX configuration parsed and analyzed

Amplify Agent is able to automatically find all relevant NGINX configuration files, parse configuration, extract their logical structure and send the associated JSON data to Amplify SaaS for further analysis and reports. For more information on configuration analysis and reports see the [Amplify documentation](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-doc).
