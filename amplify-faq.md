## 1. General

### 1.1. What is NGINX Amplify?

NGINX Amplify is a tool for comprehensive NGINX monitoring. With Amplify it becomes possible to proactively analyze and fix problems related to running and scaling NGINX-based web application architectures.

You can use NGINX Amplify to do the following:

 * Visualize and identify NGINX performance bottlenecks, overloaded servers, or potential DDoS attacks
 * Improve and optimize NGINX performance with intelligent advice and recommendations
 * Get notified when something is wrong with the application delivery
 * Plan web application capacity and performance
 * Keep track of the systems running NGINX
 
### 1.2. Where is the Main System Hosted?

NGINX Amplify SaaS is currently hosted in [AWS us-west-1](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) (US West, N. California).

### 1.3. Is the Traffic from the Agent to the SaaS Protected?

All communications between the Amplify Agent and the Amplify SaaS backend are done securely over TLS/SSL. All traffic is always initiated by the agent. The backend system doesn't establish any connections back to the agent running on a host.

### 1.4. Is the Amplify Agent Code Publicly Available?

Amplify Agent is an open source application. It is licensed under the [2-clause BSD license](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-agent/blob/master/LICENSE), and is available [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-agent).

### 1.5. Why is This Question About My Password When Installing the Agent?

It could be that you're starting the install script from a non-root account. In this case you will need *sudo* rights. That's most probably *sudo* asking for a password.


## 2. NGINX Amplify Agent

### 2.1. What Operatings Systems are Supported?

NGINX Amplify Agent currently works on the following Linux flavors only:

 * Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 15.04, 15.10
 * Debian 7, 8
 * CentOS 6, 7
 * Red Hat 6, 7 (and systems based on it, e.g. Oracle Server)
 * Amazon Linux (latest release)

### 2.2. What Version of Python is Required?

NGINX Amplify Agent will work with Python 2.6+.

### 2.3. How do I Add a New system to the Monitoring?

This could done as simple as follows:

 1. Download and run install script.

        # curl -sS -L -O \
        https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-agent/raw/master/packages/install.sh && \
        API_KEY='ecfdee2e010899135c258d741a6effc7' sh ./install.sh

    where API_KEY is a unique API key assigned when you create an account with Amplify. You will see your API key when adding new system in the Amplify web interface.

 2. Verify that Amplify agent has started.

        # ps ax | grep -i 'amplify\-'
        2552 ?        S      0:00 amplify-agent

For manual installation instructions, please check the user guide [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-doc/blob/master/amplify-guide.md#installing-amplify-agent-manually).

### 2.4. What do I Need to Configure for the Amplify Agent to Properly Report Metrics?

After you install and start the agent, normally it should just start reporting right away, pushing aggregated data to the Amplify backend at regular 1 minute intervals. It'll take about a minute for the new system to appear in the Amplify web interface.

If you don't see the new system in the web interface, or metrics aren't being collected, please check the following:

 1. Amplify Agent package has been successfully installed
 2. `amplify-agent` process is running
 3. stub_status is [properly set up](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-doc/blob/master/amplify-guide.md#configuring-nginx-for-amplify-metric-collection) in your NGINX configuration
 4. NGINX [access.log](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html) and [error.log](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#error_log) files are readable by the user `nginx` (or by the [user](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#user) configured in NGINX config)
 5. Some additional metrics for NGINX require extra [configuration steps](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-doc/blob/master/amplify-guide.md#additional-http-metrics).
 6. System DNS resolver is properly configured, and `receiver.amplify.nginx.com` can be successfully resolved.
 7. Oubound TLS/SSL from the system to `receiver.amplify.nginx.com` is not restricted
 8. Check if *selinux(8)* interferes. Check `/etc/selinux/config`, try `setenforce 0` temporarily and see if it improves the situation for certain metrics.

### 2.5. How to Verify if the Amplify Agent is Correctly Installed?

 1. On Ubuntu/Debian

```
    # dpkg -s nginx-amplify-agent
```

 2. On CentOS and Red Hat

```
    # yum info nginx-amplify-agent
```

### 2.6. How Can I Update the Amplify Agent?

 1. On Ubuntu/Debian use
 
```
    # apt-get update && \
    apt-get install nginx-amplify-agent

    # service amplify-agent restart
```

 2. On CentOS use

```
    # yum makecache && \
    yum update nginx-amplify-agent

    # service amplify-agent restart
```

### 2.7. How Much System Resources are Required?

We worked very hard to make the agent retain as small memory and CPU footprint as possible. Normally it shouldn't be more than a few % of CPU time, and around 25-30MB of RSS memory.
   
### 2.8. How to Restart the Amplify Agent?

It's as simple as

```
    # service amplify-agent restart
```

### 2.9 How Can I Uninstall the Amplify Agent?

 1. On Ubuntu/Debian use


```
    apt-get remove nginx-amplify-agent
```

 2. On CentOS and Red Hat use

```
    yum remove nginx-amplify-agent
```

### 2.10 How Can I Override a System's Hostname?
 
If the agent is not able to determine the system's hostname, you can define it manually in `/etc/amplify-agent/agent.conf`. Check for the following section, and fill in the desired hostname:

```
    [credentials]
    ..
    hostname = myhostname1
```

Hostname should be something real — the following aren't valid hostnames:

 * localhost
 * localhost.localdomain
 * localhost6.localdomain6
 * ip6-localhost

## 3. User Interface

### 3.1. What Browsers are Supported?

Currently the following desktop browsers are officially fully supported:

 * Chrome
 * Firefox
 * Safari
 * Opera

### 3.2. Is the Web Interface Traffic Secure?

We only support TLS/SSL connections to the Amplify web interface.

### 3.3. How can I Delete a System or an NGINX Instance from Monitoring?

If the goal is to completely delete previously monitored object, then do the following:

 * Uninstall the agent
 * Delete objects from the web interface
 * Delete alarms.

To delete system from the web interface — find it in the list, hover, click vertical dots on the right, extend toolbar and choose the [i] icon. There you can delete objects.

Bear in mind — deleting objects there will not stop the agent. To completely remove system from monitoring, please stop or uninstall the agent first, and then clean it up in the web interface. Don't forget to also clean up any alarms.


## 4. Metrics and Metadata

### 4.1. What Metrics and Metadata are Collected?

NGINX Amplify Agent collects the following type of data:

 * **System metadata.** This is basic information about the OS environment where the agent runs. This could be hostname, uptime information, and so on.
 * **System metrics.** This is various data describing key system characteristics, e.g. CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic etc.
 * **NGINX metadata.** This is what describes your NGINX instances, and it includes package data, build information, path to binary, configure options etc. NGINX metadata also includes config file breakdown.
 * **NGINX metrics.** Amplify Agent collects NGINX related metrics from [stub_status](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html), and also from the NGINX logs files.

Amplify Agent will mostly use Python's [psutil()](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) to collect the data, but may occasionally invoke certain system utilities like *ps(1)*.

### 4.2. How is the NGINX Configuration Parsed and Analyzed?

Amplify Agent is able to automatically find all relevant NGINX configuration files, parse configuration, extract their logical structure and send the associated JSON data to Amplify backend for further analysis and reports.

For more information on configuration analysis and reports see the [Amplify documentation](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-amplify-doc/blob/master/amplify-guide.md#nginx-configuration-reports).
